# Smart-Agriculture-Using-IoT
Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought revolution to each and every field of common manâ€™slife by making everything smart and intelligent. IoT refers to a network of things which make a self-configuring network. The development of Intelligent Smart Agriculture IoT based devices is day by day turning the face of agriculture production by not only enhancing it but also making it cost-effective and reducing wastage. The aim / objective of this report is to propose IoT based Smart Agriculture System assisting farmers in getting Data (Temperature, Soil Moisture) for efficient environment monitoring which will enable them to increase their overall yield and quality of products. The IoT based Smart Farming System being proposed via this report is integrated with Arduino Technology mixed with different Sensors .
